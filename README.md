# Project Description
This repo contains a basic machine learning API built with **FastAPI**, a modern, fast, and asynchronous web framework for building APIs with Python. The API features continuous integration with **GitHub Actions**, allowing developers to automatically run the build system on every code change. It also includes continuous delivery through **AWS App Runner**, enabling automatic deployments of new versions of the API to the cloud. This ensures that the API is always up-to-date and reliable, providing a seamless experience for users.

AWS App Runner is a managed service that automatically builds and deploys containerized web applications. It allows developers to quickly and easily deploy their applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. With App Runner, developers can focus on building their application while the service handles the details of building, deploying, and scaling the application. This makes it easy to continuously deliver updates to the application without downtime or manual effort.
